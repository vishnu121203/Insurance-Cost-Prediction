# InsuranceCost Prediction

## Overview
Insurance Cost Prediction is a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting the cost of medical insurance based on various factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. This project uses regression models to analyze historical data and estimate insurance premiums accurately.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training using various regression algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Performance evaluation using key metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared)
- Deployment-ready model for API integration

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following attributes:
- **age**: Age of the policyholder
- **sex**: Gender of the policyholder
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **children**: Number of dependents
- **smoker**: Whether the policyholder smokes (yes/no)
- **region**: Geographic region (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast)
- **charges**: Insurance cost (target variable)
